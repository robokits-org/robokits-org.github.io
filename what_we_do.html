Our program aims to create three separate kits that can be easily assembled by any middle school student, similar to a Lego kit. These kits will teach kids basic engineering concepts and simple coding mechanics in the Arduino IDE. After assembling each kit, the kids will be encouraged to further experiment with editing the code or making changes to the project itself to get a hands-on experience in engineering and computer science.

We are a group of high schoolers who are interested in pursuing higher education and careers in STEM thanks to various sources of inspiration. Our goal in creating the STEM Kits Project is to provide a fun and engaging source of inspiration to middle schoolers who may be unsure whether or not they want to pursue a technology related career.
